# My Emacs Config

It's been over a year now that I've used Doom Emacs. I loved the way it did so many things. I like how the author uses keybindings, organizes the config files, and so on. I don't want to stop using it until I have a solid foundation to work off of with my own configuration. With that in mind I'm starting to engineer my config from the ground up, which I think will be a large task.

Some definite things:
* straight.el (mainly to try it out)
* vterm
* Evil mode
* Treemacs
* Magit
* Major modes for: web, python, rust, and haskell (for now)
* Flycheck, company; the works...
* A system of keybindings similar to Doom, probably not the exact same though
