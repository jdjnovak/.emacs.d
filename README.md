I finally decided to upload my .emacs.d.  
  
I've split it into a few files based on their function.  
* init.el - Initializes and calls all my other files
* backups.el - Puts all backup files into the backup folder (not included in the repo)
* company.el - Initializes company and changes default delay
* evil.el - Activates evil (*NOTE: I downloaded the source for evil, but excluded the folder from this repo*)
* fonts.el - When I want to use a font
* personal.el - All my random personal keybindings and configs
* sources.el - add Melpa and Org sources
* treemacs-bindings.el - Treemacs(evil) custom keybindings
* web-mode.el - Initialize web-mode and alter some indenting
* typescript.el - For all necessary typescript autocomplete and other useful things
* themes.el - Select themes and the GUI transparency
* nlinum.el - Settings for nlinum-relative mode
* smartmodeline.el - Settings for the Smart Line - Atom Dark status bar
* rust.el - Set up rustic mode
* python-conf.el - File that sets up jedi server for python files
