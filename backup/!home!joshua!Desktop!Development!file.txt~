# Adventure With Ludum Dare 44
============================

I had the absolute pleasure to take part in Ludum Dare 44 from April 26, 2019 to April 28, 2019.
As my second game jam ever, it was an absolute blast! (Highly recommended!)

It happens twice a year, so from this experience I will be way better equipped to take on the
next one in six months! I learned so much in the 43.5 hours that I had to work on my game.

## Day 1: 26/04 - 9PM to 27/04 - 2:30AM
9:00 PM EDT, the jam is on! I've decided to take part in the Compo (solo work, all assets
created by myself during the jam timeframe) and I had a lot of work ahead on me. The first
thing was the theme and style of my game. LD44's theme was "Your Life is Currency". After much
deliberation, idea bouncing with people at home, some brainstorming, etc, I decided on a 2D
top-down survival game using Unity2D.

### My Game
I decided on the name "Final Spark". You play as a spark/ball-of-light-thing that runs on a
battery that continually drains. Your goal is to run around the map collecting charge boosts
as to counter act the ever increasing drain on your battery per second. In the center of the
map there is a shop you can buy upgrades to your character (such as higher max energy, higher
movement speed, cutting the drain by half). The big curve ball is that the map is completely
dark, except for the circle of light emitted by your character. As your energy percentage
decreases, so too does the brightness of your light.

## Day 2: 27/04 - 10AM(ish?) to 28/04 - 3AM
This was the longest period of time I got to work on Final Spark. I had very little experience
with drawing sprites, but wow: it's actually a ton of fun!
